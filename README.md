🤖 AI Automation Client Onboarding Agent – n8n Workflow
Welcome to the AI Automation Client Onboarding Agent – a powerful no-code/low-code workflow built on n8n that automates and streamlines the entire client onboarding process for digital service agencies.

📌 What Is This AI Agent?
This n8n-based AI agent automates the end-to-end onboarding process for new clients, making it fast, scalable, and error-free.

✨ Key Features:
📥 Accepts client onboarding form submissions

📁 Automatically creates structured folders in Google Drive

🧠 Extracts tasks from proposals using GPT-4o via OpenAI

✅ Parses and breaks down proposals into 20–30 detailed subtasks

📋 Instantly populates a ClickUp project (folders, lists, tasks)
